# djangotry
this file is meant for description purpose only.
Django is a python based framework.
I am trying web dev via django.
In this repository there are many files and directories.
.py are executable files, which help our webpage to connect with server.
webpages' formatting and layouting is done using html and css.
.html files are not executable.
